Description
===========

A chef cookbook - just one recipe, actually - for building your own hand-rolled ruby (i.e. compiled from source).

We use this with this knife bootstrap script https://gist.github.com/187db04bf70b50659ec2 so that chef, ohai etc AND our webapps use the same, latest stable ruby.
